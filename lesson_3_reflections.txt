When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It would make sense to use a remote repository when there are multiple people working on a project on different computers. Using a remote repository will make collaboration easier and faster.


/*
Commands learnt:
git remote - shows all the remotesset for a particular git repository
git remote add <remote_name> <url> - creates a new remote with the given remote name and as the passed url
git push <remote_name> <branch_name> - Pushes changes made in the given branch of the repository to the remote specified
git remote -v - shows the urls set as the remote (both fetch - from which pull requests will be made; push - to which changes will be sent)
